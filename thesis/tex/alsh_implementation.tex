Vector hashing is parallelized with respect to hash tables --- entries are inserted in parallel
into every hash table. It is accomplished by an OpenMP directive before the loop iterating through
hash tables.
The source of randomness for this algorithm is \texttt{std::mt19937} which is Mersenne
Twister 19937 pseudo-random generator.
Hash tables are stored in a \texttt{std::vector} of structures, each containing
randomly generated hash constants and a \texttt{std::map} mapping
metahash key (implemented by \texttt{uint64\_t}) to \texttt{std::set} of vector indices.
In order to calculate metahash, $K$ single hashes as described in chapter 2.3 are computed.
Then, all these hashes are combined into one metahash key (\texttt{seed}) using an approach from
\texttt{boost} library. Adding every hash value \texttt{v} to existing \texttt{seed} is done
by instruction containing a magic number:
\begin{verbatim}
seed ^= v + 0x9e3779b9 + (seed<<6) + (seed>>2);
\end{verbatim}

Answering queries is also carried out in parallel by OpenMP. It ensures high scalability in situations
where many queries have to be answered at once. First, colliding vectors are found in all hash
tables and placed in an \texttt{std::unordered\_set}. Next, exact inner product (vector's score)
between query and the colliders is calculated by \path{faiss::fvec_inner_product} procedure from Faiss library.
Score processing is identical as in quantization, except best vectors are not returned but
written to resultant \texttt{FlatMatrix}. Truncation is necessary only in case there were more
colliders than $k$.
If less than $k$ vectors collided, remaining fields are filled with $-1$'s as required by
Faiss API.
